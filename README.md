### What is this?
These installers provide an all-in-one offline solution containing all the packages associated with the types of files they are designed to install.

### Why should I install this?
Windows PCs often depend on Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes and DirectX to run many types of programs. This includes, but is not limited to, games and desktop applications like the Dropbox Desktop Program.

### How to install
To install, run the file "RunMe.bat" as an administrator. To do this, right-click the file and select "Run as administrator."

### About silent installation
The installation process uses a silent installer, which means the command prompt window (`cmd.exe`) may appear blank at times. This is intentional to provide a hands-free experience. DO NOT CLOSE THE `cmd.exe` WINDOW PREMATURELY, even if it seems like nothing is happening. Let the installer complete its process and you will get a message letting you know when the script has completed.

### Is it working?
To check if the installation is working, open the Task Manager and go to the `Details` tab. Then, filter by CPU usage. You should see high CPU usage from each installer when they are executing and actively installing files.
